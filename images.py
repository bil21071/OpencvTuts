#The Images are the Numpy Arrays
#An image is given by height input and the number of channels
# import cv2
# image=cv2.imread("Image Link")
# print(image.shape)
#An image is made by pixels
#Pixels are the block each block is a pixel
#Possible value from pixel is 0 to  in binary it is in [0,1] range
#in 16 bit images pixel value range from 0 to 65536
#   Each channels in pixels have co-ordinates the Blue green red channel
# we will be working with the Binary Images
#All white pixels are 1 and black pixels have value 0
